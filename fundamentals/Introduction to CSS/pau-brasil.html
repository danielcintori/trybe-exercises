    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p id="tree-size">The tree reaches between ten and fifteen meters in height and has a straight trunk with dark gray bark covered in thorns, especially on the younger branches.

        The flowers grow in erect racemes near the apex of the branches. They have four yellow petals and a smaller red one, highly aromatic; at the center, there are ten stamens and a pistil with an elongated superior ovary.
        
        The fruits are pods covered in long, sharp thorns, which protect them from unwanted birds that would eat the fruits. They contain from one to five discoid seeds, brown in color. The twisting of the pod, upon releasing the seeds, helps increase the distance of dispersion.</p>
